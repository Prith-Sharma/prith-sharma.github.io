Hello!

I am an upcoming MSAII student at Carnegie Mellon University (LTI, School of Computer Science). I was previously a Research Intern at Microsoft Research and interned under the guidance of [Dr. Rohan Gandhi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3jZznJIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Sreangsu Acharyya](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/srach/). I have also been a Junior Research Fellow at IIIT Hyderabad under [Dr. Charu Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bftN0M0AAAAJ), where I worked on 3-D Dynamic point cloud classification. At MSR, I worked on implementing the Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing method with a nuanced hyperparameter optimization and training pattern to perform forecasts on Microsoft Bing data and to observe the effect of multiple seasonalities on the training. 

Prior to this, I worked at 5C-Network as a Data Science and Computer Vision Intern on L5/S1 disc dislocation detection using ML and Deep Learning techniques. Along the way, I have also collaborated with professors from my undergraduate college, VIT Vellore and have also worked on detection of UTI in pregnant women in collaboration with CMC Vellore and ICMR under the guidance of [Dr. M. Monica Subashini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0L1kg2AAAAAJ).
My interests lie in the domains of AI for healthcare, time series forecasting, Geometric Deep Learning, Optimization and high dimensional statistics.

I have always been an avid quizzer and spell bee enthusiast since my school days and even featured on TV in the show of [Wordmatch](https://youtu.be/vRzYCp0w17U?feature=shared), which aired on the channel of ZeeQ in India.
